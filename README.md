Hi! Welcome to my Projects folder! my name is Sarah and I am a computer science student. In this Projects folder you will see a backend java
currency exchange which uses an API to get those exchange rates. Its my first time using an API in a project and this has opned new doors for me!
I wonder what else I can create.
